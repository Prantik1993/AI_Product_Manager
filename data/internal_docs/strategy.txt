   drones, IoT hardware, or wearables. Any hardware component in a proposal is an automatic NO-GO.
2. NO CRYPTO / BLOCKCHAIN: We do not engage in cryptocurrency, blockchain mining, NFT trading,
   or DeFi due to environmental impact and regulatory uncertainty.

   Ideas requiring more than $50k to reach MVP stage are automatically disqualified.
