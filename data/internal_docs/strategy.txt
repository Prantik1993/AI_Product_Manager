CONFIDENTIAL: COMPANY STRATEGY & PRODUCT GUIDELINES (2025-2026)

SECTION 1: CORE MISSION
Our mission is to build "Sustainable Software for the Future." We prioritize ethical AI, environmental sustainability, and privacy-first architecture.

SECTION 2: STRICT PRODUCT RULES (THE "HARD NO" LIST)
1. NO HARDWARE: We are a pure software company. We do not manufacture physical devices, drones, or wearables. Any hardware proposal must be rejected immediately.
2. NO CRYPTO: We do not engage in cryptocurrency, blockchain mining, or NFT trading due to environmental impact.
3. NO GAMBLING: We do not build betting or casino-related applications.
4. BUDGET CAP: The maximum initial budget for any MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is $50,000. Ideas requiring >$50k to start are disqualified.

SECTION 3: TARGET AUDIENCE
Our primary focus is Gen Z and Millennials (Ages 18-40). We do not build enterprise legacy software for banks or government sectors.

SECTION 4: TECHNICAL STANDARDS
- All apps must be cloud-native (AWS/Azure).
- We prefer Python and React stacks.
- We do not support on-premise deployments.

SECTION 5: RISK TOLERANCE
We have a LOW risk tolerance for legal issues. Any product that scrapes user data without consent or violates GDPR is a NO-GO.
